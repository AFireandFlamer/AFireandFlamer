- 👋 Hi, I’m @AFireandFlamer
- 👀 I’m interested in building out projects in my life and .. in code, soon to be - things that I think are important and cool. I like discovering things that are hidden, I like finding bugs. I like fixing things also meaning solving problems.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning coding, art, and how to be a player. I think: a really important life skill.
- - 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on work that is ltimately meaningful.
- 📫 How to reach me. My Email is samfishman24@gmail.com: just include "Github" as a part of the subject line.
